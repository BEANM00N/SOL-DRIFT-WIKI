# Overview 

>"Afraid of breaking it worse and experiencing a debilitating point of no return but left without options, knowing you can't stop now - the only option to is push through"

**EXCPE** is an ==escape room puzzle solving mystery experience== that revolves around **solving puzzles**, *breaking codes* and ==uncovering an escalating mystery to EXCPE==

**GIT REPO**
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Zee-Jay76/PLP-EXCPE-01.git)

**PURPOSE**
 - Test various methods of a **INVENTORY SYSTEM**, storing key objects persistently (Through a local Save File).
 - Create a Modular **LOCK & KEY** system for fast iteration on puzzles and side quests.
 - Create a Randomized **CYPHER** that can be processed within a **CYPHER DECODER** Terminal, testing the approachability and viability of Shift Cyphers, Shakespeare Cyphers, etc.

# Mechanics 

EXPE is a Lock & Key puzzle experience, with each lock growing in abstract problem solving complexity 

---
## Key Objects/KO's

The player will engage with the game by *interacting* with **Key Objects** to solve their way out of the ==Room they are locked In!== 
When players interact with a **Key Object**  they will be prompted to *collect* the Key Object which will be placed in the player's inventory for later use! 

When in the inventory, a **Key Object** can be ==inspected to reveal clues== hidden on the **KO's** mesh such as a **code**, *hint* or a **Micro Lock Object** that needs to be solved!

## Lock Objects/LO's

*Lock Objects* are broken into several different categories all serving the purpose of presenting the player with an obstacle needing to be overcome:

	`CYPHERS
	`LOCKED ACCESIBLES
	`TERMINAL INTERFACES

---
## CYPHERS

**CYPHERS** are codes that require a *DECRYPTION-KEY* in order to be readable.

**CYPHERS** & their *DECRYPTION-KEY's* can be found hidden on 
objects, within notes and even disguised within the  
environment  
`
that  directly fuel progression, by being unlocked, broken or hacked, using one or more *key objects* 

---
## LOCKED ACCESIBLES

```


As expected in a game meant to *challenge players' persistence* to progress, LOCKED OBJECT's withholding *critical progression items, pathways or pieces of information* will be strategically used to push player's to hunt around and keep their eyes sharp on the hunt for clues a **KEY OBJECT** in order to progress!

## Diegetic Inventory System

```

A **2D UI projected onto a 3D world object**, allowing the testing of *Physical* interaction with items. Players will utilize a *Tac-Pad* to sort through *Categories*;

	Keys & Codes
	Object Items
	Collectibles
	Notepad

The Inventory system will feature a **3D Render** of the selected object, allowing functionality of rotating and zooming to find *Secret Codes* and *Secondary* - similar to *Resident Evil*'s Inventory;

## Cypher Terminal

A **Cypher Terminal** will be available to the player to deconstruct and process *Shift Cyphers*, allowing the player to insert a random *Code* and use an *Up* or *Down* **Arrow** to control how many times to shift the letters in the code and in what direction.

## Art Style

The art style is very strongly inspired by the **Utilitarian** yet **Retro** **Scifi** aesthetic that *Starfield* manages to encapsulate - Blending old and new technologies to create a canvas with an immensely strong foundation soaked in style. The goal with this atmosphere is to make the player feel familiar within the environment, accommodating the player to focus more on the gameplay and less on a potentially *Jarring* environment.
