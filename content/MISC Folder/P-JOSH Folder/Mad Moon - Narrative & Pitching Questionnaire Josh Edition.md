**Do with these, what you will, but here’s some structured questions,** 

**With some word limits, for you to fill out.** 

  

**Describe the Game, as you would to a publisher, in one or two sentences.** 

  

SOL DRIFT puts you in the pilot seat of cutting-edge Space Flight Warmachines at the forefront of a second “Cold War gone Hot”, a conflict that everyone’s grandparents warned all those who came after of never repeating the same mistake again. 

  

**Describe the Game, as you hope someone in a pub might describe it to a friend, having played it. Don’t be afraid to use other games as reference. (100 words max)**

“It’s like Top Gun in space. Just imagine Elite Dangerous mixed with the arcadeiness of Ace Combat with the personality of the Vietnam Era. Imagine a jet game, now make it faster and add a handbrake turn and put it in space.”

  

**Who is the player character? (500 words max)**

**How are you going to reconcile the player’s lack of knowledge with the player character’s lived history in this setting?**

  

Player character originates from a distant Colony State under the UCA and through their mandatory service as a young adult they distinguished themselves as a promising pilot. Following an escalation in intension between the UCA and Trisun (TBD) the UCA began stacking military forces along key strategic points which meant moving a lot of reserves from distant colonies. With this transfer to a UCA Carrier Ship the player now finds themselves suddenly in a new environment with different customs, expectations filled with unspoken rules, and harsh consequences to conduct. To survive, the player must adapt accordingly whilst the threat of war escalates and their re-deployment looks less like a promotion and more like a sentence.

  

Thankfully, the player was not sent into this new endeavor alone, when the player was first drafted, their home-colony best friend and companion enlisted that same day to join up too. During their shared training, the player and their friend shared a natural synergy leading to them serving in the same aircraft together as a pilot and a WSO (Weapons systems Operator).

  

  

**How do you plan to bridge the gap between the player’s knowledge, and the player character’s knowledge, if at all?**

Given the Player’s new found position in both environment and social standing they’re naturally at a disadvantage when it comes to understanding the customs of their surroundings and the inherent stakes at play. Therefore, both the player character and player themselves are in the same position of needing to learn the ropes, processes and hierarchy within this new setting. We’re planning on capitalizing as much as we can from the self insert “silent protagonist” and create a natural feeling of symbiosis and relation between the two; The Player’s learning curve is the Character’s. Furthermore, the choice to make the player a trainee pilot “of promise” explains them needing to go through general gameplay onboarding under the guise of training, a common method that helps reinforce a natural feeling introduction to the world and it’s characters, whilst bridging the connection to gameplay.

The way we want to communicate that feeling of being a lost lamb in a new place is initially through dialogue with other characters  (Squad mates, Commander, ground crew and automated Artificial Intelligence). We’re also interested in communicating the player’s home history and background through messages that they receive in their terminal, from family members saying their goodbyes and even smoldering letters from the burnt bridges they left behind with old friends. 

  
  

**How much of an existing character do you expect the player’s avatar to be? (500 max)** 

  
  

A lot of the information that will be available to the player is optionally explored but has an encouraged and tempting presence. Mementos and Items taken from home can be interacted with and will offer flavor text and context of where they came from and what kind of place that was, as well as establishing the idea the player character as a person, was different before the events of the game’s beginning, something that is an intentional choice as the growth, change and ultimate rebirth is a large part of SOL DRIFT’s narrative.

The player character directs the world through purely gameplay means. They are a literal vehicle being piloted by the player just like the character themselves pilots their jet. Likewise, the jet can only do what it’s told. The Character doesn’t apply input to the world - they receive it from a controller; the player and characters of higher standing within the world. However, we are utilizing the previously mentioned WSO as a proxy voice or means of expression from what would be the player character, sharing their reactions and opinions on the events that transpire. In this way, the Player, WSO and Character are all inhabiting the inner workings and dynamics of a single mind.  

  

**Describe the setting, and tone. Don’t be afraid to use other media as examples. (500 max)**

  

A surface level description of what we imagine the imagery and tonality of the setting is “Vietnam is Space”. 

**Setting:**

SOL DRIFT is following on from the current predicted trajectory of the privatization of space and applying that to the recurring lessons of tension between High-Interest groups and the resulting outbreaks of conflict that arises as a result. We aim to project the plausible outcome of what our world might look like roughly 150 years after a mass exodus of humans from Earth under the banners of various privatized space companies expanding into space using early-era space travel technology and techniques.

The state of SOL DRIFT’s universe is intended to explore the possible primitive colonial mindsets that might arise when humans separate from the confines of nation-states that have become inseparably linked to continental locations on Earth and what might occur when new flags and borders are formed in response to the new territories inhabited by a population with no inherent linkage to their ancestral homes. In essence, linking this future humanity directly to the faults and struggles of the past by showing it is an inevitable struggle of the human condition. 

  

**How far along into the story should you be starting? (200 Max)**

SOL DRIFT takes place two generations after (roughly 80 years) a massive decisively unwon war by all involved but one that could not be denied to have cost a great deal to all those who experienced it and their descendants. 

It was a watershed moment in the timeline of humanity and marked a significant transition from the innocent beginnings of the colonization of space by private companies where the borders between the colonists were purely a business concern, to new nations with citizens under new flags and law, no longer connected to Earth’s nations. 

You are the grandchildren of the generation that fought in this war, and that story lives on as just that; stories packed with warning and far off remembrance told through distant stares and foreboding warnings of repeating it.

SOL DRIFT’s story begins right before the eruption of a second war that comes after an 80 year cold war-like tension that has been slowly escalating but now has surprisingly ignited under unusual circumstances, leading to mass confusion, mixed support and a panicked mobilization. (hence the players sudden drafting from the outer-colonies)

  

**How can the game’s macro-narrative structure line up with how you’re conceptualising ‘chunks’ of the game. I.e. levels, chapters, acts, locations. (400 words)**

**Is there room for flexibility in the game’s narrative structure to accommodate cut content?**

**Do you foresee there being Dialogue options or any RPG elements in this game? Why or why not? (500 words)**

WE do not wish for any dialogue options but we do foresee a choice at the climax of the game acting as a player's indicative response to the message being told throughout the game. The reasoning for this is the aforementioned “vehicle” role the player character will perform; the story deliberately has them at the behest of other characters’/forces’ directions and intentions to amplify the message of “what happens when you no longer feel compelled by punitive consequences” - hence, at the end, the player will be given the ultimate decision, because no one else is left to stop them. 

  
**What sets the hook, narratively speaking, apart from other genre contemporaries? (200 words)**

SOL DRIFT’s setting and tone will incur the promise and lure of being less than it is but hiding so much more just under the surface that players will feel captivated by the uncertainty of what will come next, through it’s unusual and deliberately obfuscated moral messaging until the player themselves is given the opportunity to answer the question the game has been asking them and those around them throughout the game; SOL DRIFT is not attempting to tell people what the answer is, it’s asking them.

  

**Do you plan to localise this game’s narrative? Has any consideration been made thus far, as to a localisation strategy from a technical perspective.  (150 words)**

**Do other NPC’s exist within this setting? Do you have a rough idea of the character count? (1-10 core cast, 10-30, 50-100 etc.)**

**Who are the most important NPC’s that exist within the game’s story? Are there any NPC’s important to the game’s lore? Do any of these NPC’s have a pre-existing relationship to the player before the story begins? (600 words)**

 Squaddie 1 (Player's WSO): Voice of the player, originating from the same backwater colony as the player character, personally volunteering after hearing about the player character's drafting. Not acutely aware of the ins and outs of internal affairs, but inquisitive and suspicious enough to motivate the player to investigate. Initially Dismissive but aware of military's and PMC's decisions and how they affect missions and people around you. Personality slowly breaks down and cracks at the edges after engaging in the taxing missions, with a breaking point after the final conflict against Talon, where Talon is offered Mercy, but WSO executes him without hesitation, unceremoniously. WSO becomes the voice of Doctor Cardon after his death, quickly derailing the chain of command after executing yet another commanding officer, the Ops Handler, Shortly after the internal Coup fronted by the PMC, where the Carrier Ship is destroyed. Death of Ops Handler sparks final battle between player and WSO, lasting three rounds, progressing deeper into the MegaWeapon with each stage, ultimately ending with the WSO's death, but no the death of his influence...

Doctor Cardon: A genius scientist and a brilliant thinker, with weighty words and considered actions. He rivals others for being such a recognizable and intense cult of personality, akin to Kurtz or Conrad. Spearheaded initial research into FTL Travel, specializing in Wormhole Tech, disappearing shortly after testing a significant breakthrough in research, with it's launch point being a point of enormous secrecy and security within the "Black Ops" unit, with ultimately being an objective for the player to eventually follow. Enormous impact on the direction and outcome of the story, being be primary motivator and objective of the story after Act 1, through redacted terminal logs and encrypted radio chatter, jumbled signal degradation from deep space travel. Becomes a tangible character after meeting him in the beginning of Act 3. Provides the Player with the information, influence and perspective to make their decision.

Judge One: Leader of Judge Squadron, which ultimately is split into a cast of fragments of "judgement", all of which are facet of Judge One's Personality, with each loss affecting him in a specific way. Judge One and Judge Squad come after the player's carrier ship in the end of Act 1 after the UCA commit an inexcusable War Crime against Talon's general Infantry force. Judge Squad is the main rival throughout Act 2, ending in a Ultimate boss fight involving his 3 Pillars;
	Impartiality
	Transparency
	Jurisdiction
The Boss fight ends with WSO executing him.
  

**Do you have any plans for narrativising the game’s tutorialisation? Eg: do any characters teach the player core mechanics, or provide diegetic tutorial information? (300 words)**
Your first deployment teaches you the capability of your movement. " We know you did flight school but this is how we do things out here. The engineers hated us for starting it but we managed to convince them to push limits. (Talking about Drifting)". Diegetic Tutorial, involving the Squad Leader of your new Infantry taking you through an "Onboarding Course" for fresh Rookies. It's not the player being taught how to play the game, It's a disguised test of survivability to ensure the Player Character is suitable for combat, with foreshadowing lines like "You would make a great Squad Leader one day..." indicating the Squad Leader's death and imminent replacement by the Player Character, Unlocking the Squad System.

The Squad System for now is not introduced diegetically by another character in the world, but rather introduced more so as an Unlocked Feature - similar to the tone in a pop message like "NEW ABILITY UNLOCKED. PRESS "E" TO FIRE SO AND SO..." The Squad System is an extension of the player, allowing them to direct other squad members to activate a preselected ability on a visible target.
  
**Do you have an ending in mind for the game’s story? Are you planning to have multiple endings in the game? What will affect the possible endings if there are any? (500 words)**

We have two endings planned, after *The Choice* is made. The final mission is quite intense, facing the player off against their *Wingman* and *Bestfriend*, a character that had their "honorable" and "good" traits slowly twisted and deformed throughout the game, embodying the very nature of Doctor Cardon's teachings, and breaking free from the punitive restraints we humans cloak ourselves in; entering the *Heart of Darkness* so to say. Your Wingman's intentions seem *Blinded* and *Dutiful* throughout the fight, often exclaiming how there is never a chance of seeing Home again, that everyone is lost in their own little jungles out here in the void, and that it is an inevitable outcome for the rest of humanity so why let them suffer when they can be spared. throughout the fight inwards towards the center of the Mega Weapon, Wingman reminds you of the atrocities you faced from the beginning;

**Pride**: Your own side engaging in War Crimes from the beginning, slaughtering a fleet of infantry, affecting thousands upon thousands of lives. Who's there to stop you? You're the strongest after all! *Laughable...* 

**Wrath**: The Consequence of this being Talon sending their *Judge Squad*, led by *Judge One*, a force so potent and thorough that the UCA suffers enormous casualties throughout Act 2.

**Greed**: And with the *Admiralty's* forces so whittled down and beat, the PMC operatives onboard the UCA Carrier Ship planned and executed a staged *Coup*, ending in the destruction of your last place called *Home*, all done in an effort to see a number on a page go higher.

Wingman initially sees his *Duty* as his own cross to bear, an eradication so thorough and blissful, that only he should bear the responsibility of enacting it. But this is not the case after the fight, with his dying words realizing that this was the true fated outcome, with the true honor and duty being the passing of the torch onto the Player Character. He was never meant to make that decision. He was but a tool in the elaborate scheme of showing the Player the true Nature of Humanity, with it's many rotten faces...

The Player is now alone, millions of miles away from the closest Micro-Colony or UCA Carrier. Having the Wingman act as the player's voice throughout the game is essential, and paired with the Squad System Mechanic that allows the Player to control the Wingman in combat, a symbiotic relationship is formed between the two characters. A Conscience and Subconscious. One can't live without the other right? *Wrong...*
Wingman was the *last barrier* that stood in the Player's path, *Physically* in the sense of him trying to stop the player from taking the Weapon from him, and *Mentally* in the sense of holding the tying themselves to the Player's Ego, restricting them from *True* freedom of mind, body and soul. With all *Rules, Authority and Morality* being lost in the deep space, Wingman was the final Anchor to the Player Character. 

**WHO'S TO JUDGE YOU NOW? MAKE YOUR DECISION...**

The final choice offered to the player is one of Enormous Weight;

*LET THE CYCLE CONTINUE*; Destroy the Mega Weapon, sacrificing yourself in the process, but ultimately "Saving" Humanity and preserving it's "Stupid Importance". 

*PUT AN END TO CYCLE*; Fast track the Inevitable. Use the "Key" given to you by Wingman to activate the Mega Weapon, annihilating Humanity in one Fell Swoop, "Saving" them... 

Both endings communicate the same message; Make a *Sacrifice* to *Save* Humanity. 
  
**If successful, do you have any plans for future stories within this world? DLC or sequels? Do you expect the player to play as the same character or someone else? (500 words)**

Considering one of the consequences of the endings is the complete annihilation of Humanity, it's hard to imagine a direct sequel to the main story line. However, in the event that current endings change we do have a potential path forward for another story within SOL DRIFT's Universe. 

The intentional Obscurity and lack of knowledge around the ancient Mega Weapon's origins and creators sets us up nicely to create a story based off our initial ideas, one where a distant race is alerted to the *presence* and *Threat* of humanity after discovering the massive spike in Gamma Burst Activity in Human Space. This isn't fueled as a crusade, but rather as an investigation to what could have caused such a massive spike in readings, considering large amounts of Gamma Rays being released indicates a star going Supermassive and collapsing in itself, posing a major threat to local systems, especially ones containing organic life. 

Another method of introducing this new race is through the Wormhole tech. Doctor Cardon's initial disappearance was due to being "Patient Zero" of this unstable tech, which he later perfected in an effort to syphon energy from distant stars to fuel the Mega Weapon, enabling it to draw energy from huge distances, without directly affecting any local systems, which would pose a risk to the Mega Weapon. To fire off the machine, a star's energy must be syphoned and repurposed. This star could belong to this new Race, resulting in the utter destruction of one of their *Home Systems*, with them coming after humanity as a consequence - a crusade on the tyranny of Humanity.

**What additional mechanic, explicit or implicit, are you expecting to rely on to convey important story information? (200 words)**

The *Squad System* will be absolutely paramount in building the symbiotic relationship between the Player and Wingman. Having the two characters rely on each other physically within combat and to get through a lot of the ups and downs within the narrative, triumphing and adapting over all the challenges thrown at them, not only "justifies" the actions and motivations of Wingman's enlightenment and reactions, but also solidifies these characters as two sides of the same coin, an idiom so critical to the player's choice in the end.
Not as important of a mechanic but certainly one that enforces the danger and instability of Cardon's research is the Wormhole tech that gets introduced to the player after discovering the initial Site Cardon disappeared from, altering gameplay significantly and signifying a major change in the direction of the story and methods the player took advantage of throughout. 
  
**Does this game have a defined antagonist? (doesn’t necessarily have to) (100 words)**

The only consistently defined "Antagonist" within the story would be Talon's *Judge One*, who's involvement certainly dictates a large portion of the mission and narrative flow from the middle of Act 1 to the End of Act 2, with a sudden shift in direction after his death and the discovery of Doctor Cardon. In some sense of the word, Cardon embodies the new "Antagonist" of the story from then on, more so as a *Dangerous Idol* or a *Cult of Personality* rather than a direct instigator like *Judge One*. His teachings and perspective hangs in the air as the player approaches their objective.
In some sense the PMC Figurehead can be labelled as an antagonist, but only in the beginning of Act 3 when he stages a Coup after the weakening of Admiralty Forces as a result of the final conflict with *Judge Squad*, with this conflict serving itself as "the last straw" in the Wingman's belief in humanity.
  

**If you were to break your story down into key beats, from beginning to end, what would those story moments look like? (500 words)**


**Are you intending the player character to go on a personal arc of some kind? What should the player character learn (or fail to learn) by the end of the game’s story. How is this congruent with the message of the game? (400 words)**

Whether the player realizes early or not, they are taken on a journey from the very beginning, moving from one front to another, witnessing and partaking in the several conflicts, each fueled by a specific aspect of humanity. Most of these conflicts are chosen to show a specific face of humanity and to specifically show that particular "face" crumble in front of the player, no matter if it ends in "Triumph" or "Defeat", all in an effort to fuel the player for that final decision. As the Player moves from one Front to another, the confidence and clarity in decisions and motives of other characters in the story starts to break down, representing that degradation of Authority and Morality the deeper their vessel goes. Comparing missions from one Front to the Last should show a clear difference and progression, or rather *Regression*, in the following;

**Carrier Ship's physical integrity**:  As the vessel moves from one front to another, the player should be able to see visible changes in the ship's internal structures, with power being rerouted from one sector to another, machinery and components being stripped away from "non-priority" sectors to maintain core functionality. The Carrier Ship acts a physical representation of how these missions are breaking everyone down. 

**Ship Crew Relationships**: Similar to the Ship's physical integrity, the relationships and cracks in personalities start to emerge and twist as the missions progress. Disparity in commands from the various Heads; Ops Handler, PMC Figurehead, Flight Admiral, all conflicting with separate motives under one roof, with none ultimately succeeding.

Just as Marlow saw the regression of common society on his journey up the river (HoD), Our Player must also bear witness to this degradation in a lawless land and specifically what lies at the heart of it all. **What happens to the Ego when punitive consequence is of no threat...**
  

**Have any core themes emerged from this stage of development? What are you saying as developers through this game, consciously or otherwise? (200 words)**

**The absurdity of Evil**; This game is, above all, an exploration of hypocrisy, ambiguity, and moral confusion. It explores the idea of the proverbial choice between the lesser of two evils. As the Player Character is forced to align themselves with either the hypocritical and mismanaged colonial bureaucracy of the UCA or the openly malevolent, rule-defying, merciful ideology of Doctor Cardon, it becomes increasingly clear that to try to judge either alternative is an act of folly: how can moral standards or social values be relevant in judging evil? Is there such thing as insanity in a world that has already gone insane? *Adapted from a [HoD analysis on SparkNotes](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart-of-darkness/themes/#:~:text=The%20Absurdity%20of%20Evil)*

**Isolation without Rules**; As mentioned previously, this game relies heavily on communicating the regression of the human Ego by hammering our characters with confusing mission objectives, Futile Internal affairs between the levels of command, and finally the end result of stripping away what little was already holding back the impulses of some characters in this story and how that new found freedom or "enlightenment" affects their actions. What happens if we allow the player to feel this?

**How would you like players to feel at the beginning of your game? How would you like them to feel when the credits roll? (500 words)**
