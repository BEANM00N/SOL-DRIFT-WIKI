**Do with these, what you will, but here’s some structured questions,** 

**With some word limits, for you to fill out.** 

  

**Describe the Game, as you would to a publisher, in one or two sentences.** 

  

SOL DRIFT puts you in the pilot seat of cutting-edge Space Flight Warmachines at the forefront of a second “Cold War gone Hot”, a conflict that everyone’s grandparents warned all those who came after of never repeating the same mistake again. 

  

**Describe the Game, as you hope someone in a pub might describe it to a friend, having played it. Don’t be afraid to use other games as reference. (100 words max)**

  

“It’s like Top Gun in space. Just imagine Elite Dangerous mixed with the arcadeiness of Ace Combat with the personality of the Vietnam Era. Imagine a jet game, now make it faster and add a handbrake turn and put it in space.”

  

**Who is the player character? (500 words max)**

**How are you going to reconcile the player’s lack of knowledge with the player character’s lived history in this setting?**

  

Player character originates from a distant Colony State under the UCA and through their mandatory service as a young adult they distinguished themselves as a promising pilot. Following an escalation in intension between the UCA and Trisun (TBD) the UCA began stacking military forces along key strategic points which meant moving a lot of reserves from distant colonies. With this transfer to a UCA Carrier Ship the player now finds themselves suddenly in a new environment with different customs, expectations filled with unspoken rules, and harsh consequences to conduct. To survive, the player must adapt accordingly whilst the threat of war escalates and their re-deployment looks less like a promotion and more like a sentence.

  

Thankfully, the player was not sent into this new endeavor alone, when the player was first drafted, their home-colony best friend and companion enlisted that same day to join up too. During their shared training, the player and their friend shared a natural synergy leading to them serving in the same aircraft together as a pilot and a WSO (Weapons systems Operator).

  

  

**How do you plan to bridge the gap between the player’s knowledge, and the player character’s knowledge, if at all?**

Given the Player’s new found position in both environment and social standing they’re naturally at a disadvantage when it comes to understanding the customs of their surroundings and the inherent stakes at play. Therefore, both the player character and player themselves are in the same position of needing to learn the ropes, processes and hierarchy within this new setting. We’re planning on capitalizing as much as we can from the self insert “silent protagonist” and create a natural feeling of symbiosis and relation between the two; The Player’s learning curve is the Character’s. Furthermore, the choice to make the player a trainee pilot “of promise” explains them needing to go through general gameplay onboarding under the guise of training, a common method that helps reinforce a natural feeling introduction to the world and it’s characters, whilst bridging the connection to gameplay.

The way we want to communicate that feeling of being a lost lamb in a new place is initially through dialogue with other characters  (Squad mates, Commander, ground crew and automated Artificial Intelligence). We’re also interested in communicating the player’s home history and background through messages that they receive in their terminal, from family members saying their goodbyes and even smoldering letters from the burnt bridges they left behind with old friends. 

  
  

**How much of an existing character do you expect the player’s avatar to be? (500 max)** 

  
  

A lot of the information that will be available to the player is optionally explored but has an encouraged and tempting presence. Mementos and Items taken from home can be interacted with and will offer flavor text and context of where they came from and what kind of place that was, as well as establishing the idea the player character as a person, was different before the events of the game’s beginning, something that is an intentional choice as the growth, change and ultimate rebirth is a large part of SOL DRIFT’s narrative.

The player character directs the world through purely gameplay means. They are a literal vehicle being piloted by the player just like the character themselves pilots their jet. Likewise, the jet can only do what it’s told. The Character doesn’t apply input to the world - they receive it from a controller; the player and characters of higher standing within the world. However, we are utilizing the previously mentioned WSO as a proxy voice or means of expression from what would be the player character, sharing their reactions and opinions on the events that transpire. In this way, the Player, WSO and Character are all inhabiting the inner workings and dynamics of a single mind.  

  

**Describe the setting, and tone. Don’t be afraid to use other media as examples. (500 max)**

  

A surface level description of what we imagine the imagery and tonality of the setting is “Vietnam is Space”. 

**Setting:**

SOL DRIFT is following on from the current predicted trajectory of the privatization of space and applying that to the recurring lessons of tension between High-Interest groups and the resulting outbreaks of conflict that arises as a result. We aim to project the plausible outcome of what our world might look like roughly 150 years after a mass exodus of humans from Earth under the banners of various privatized space companies expanding into space using early-era space travel technology and techniques.

The state of SOL DRIFT’s universe is intended to explore the possible primitive colonial mindsets that might arise when humans separate from the confines of nation-states that have become inseparably linked to continental locations on Earth and what might occur when new flags and borders are formed in response to the new territories inhabited by a population with no inherent linkage to their ancestral homes. In essence, linking this future humanity directly to the faults and struggles of the past by showing it is an inevitable struggle of the human condition. 

  

**How far along into the story should you be starting? (200 Max)**

SOL DRIFT takes place two generations after (roughly 80 years) a massive decisively unwon war by all involved but one that could not be denied to have cost a great deal to all those who experienced it and their descendants. 

It was a watershed moment in the timeline of humanity and marked a significant transition from the innocent beginnings of the colonization of space by private companies where the borders between the colonists were purely a business concern, to new nations with citizens under new flags and law, no longer connected to Earth’s nations. 

You are the grandchildren of the generation that fought in this war, and that story lives on as just that; stories packed with warning and far off remembrance told through distant stares and foreboding warnings of repeating it.

SOL DRIFT’s story begins right before the eruption of a second war that comes after an 80 year cold war-like tension that has been slowly escalating but now has surprisingly ignited under unusual circumstances, leading to mass confusion, mixed support and a panicked mobilization. (hence the players sudden drafting from the outer-colonies)

  

**How can the game’s macro-narrative structure line up with how you’re conceptualising ‘chunks’ of the game. I.e. levels, chapters, acts, locations. (400 words)**

**Is there room for flexibility in the game’s narrative structure to accommodate cut content?**

**Do you foresee there being Dialogue options or any RPG elements in this game? Why or why not? (500 words)**

WE do not wish for any dialogue options but we do foresee a choice at the climax of the game acting as a player's indicative response to the message being told throughout the game. The reasoning for this is the aforementioned “vehicle” role the player character will perform; the story deliberately has them at the behest of other characters’/forces’ directions and intentions to amplify the message of “what happens when you no longer feel compelled by punitive consequences” - hence, at the end, the player will be given the ultimate decision, because no one else is left to stop them. 

  
**What sets the hook, narratively speaking, apart from other genre contemporaries? (200 words)**

SOL DRIFT’s setting and tone will incur the promise and lure of being less than it is but hiding so much more just under the surface that players will feel captivated by the uncertainty of what will come next, through it’s unusual and deliberately obfuscated moral messaging until the player themselves is given the opportunity to answer the question the game has been asking them and those around them throughout the game; SOL DRIFT is not attempting to tell people what the answer is, it’s asking them.

  

**Do you plan to localise this game’s narrative? Has any consideration been made thus far, as to a localisation strategy from a technical perspective.  (150 words)**

**Do other NPC’s exist within this setting? Do you have a rough idea of the character count? (1-10 core cast, 10-30, 50-100 etc.)**

**Who are the most important NPC’s that exist within the game’s story? Are there any NPC’s important to the game’s lore? Do any of these NPC’s have a pre-existing relationship to the player before the story begins? (600 words)**

 Squaddie 1 (Player's WSO): Voice of the player, originating from the same backwater colony as the player character, personally volunteering after hearing about the player character's drafting. Not acutely aware of the ins and outs of internal affairs, but inquisitive and suspicious enough to motivate the player to investigate. Initially Dismissive but aware of military's and PMC's decisions and how they affect missions and people around you. Personality slowly breaks down and cracks at the edges after engaging in the taxing missions, with a breaking point after the final conflict against Talon, where Talon is offered Mercy, but WSO executes him without hesitation, unceremoniously. WSO becomes the voice of Doctor Cardon after his death, quickly derailing the chain of command after executing yet another commanding officer, the Ops Handler, Shortly after the internal Coup fronted by the PMC, where the Carrier Ship is destroyed. Death of Ops Handler sparks final battle between player and WSO, lasting three rounds, progressing deeper into the MegaWeapon with each stage, ultimately ending with the WSO's death, but no the death of his influence...

Doctor Cardon: A genius scientist and a brilliant thinker, with weighty words and considered actions. He rivals others for being such a recognizable and intense cult of personality, akin to Kurtz or Conrad. Spearheaded initial research into FTL Travel, specializing in Wormhole Tech, disappearing shortly after testing a significant breakthrough in research, with it's launch point being a point of enormous secrecy and security within the "Black Ops" unit, with ultimately being an objective for the player to eventually follow. Enormous impact on the direction and outcome of the story, being be primary motivator and objective of the story after Act 1, through redacted terminal logs and encrypted radio chatter, jumbled signal degradation from deep space travel. Becomes a tangible character after meeting him in the beginning of Act 3. Provides the Player with the information, influence and perspective to make their decision.

Judge One: Leader of Judge Squadron, which ultimately is split into a cast of fragments of "judgement", all of which are facet of Judge One's Personality, with each loss affecting him in a specific way. Judge One and Judge Squad come after the player's carrier ship in the end of Act 1 after the UCA commit an inexcusable War Crime against Talon's general Infantry force. Judge Squad is the main rival throughout Act 2, ending in a Ultimate boss fight involving his 3 Pillars;
	Impartiality
	Transparency
	Jurisdiction
The Boss fight ends with WSO executing him.
  

**Do you have any plans for narrativising the game’s tutorialisation? Eg: do any characters teach the player core mechanics, or provide diegetic tutorial information? (300 words)**
Your first deployment teaches you the capability of your movement. " We know you did flight school but this is how we do things out here. The engineers hated us for starting it but we managed to convince them to push limits. (Talking about Drifting)". Diegetic Tutorial, involving the Squad Leader of your new Infantry taking you through an "Onboarding Course" for fresh Rookies. It's not the player being taught how to play the game, It's a disguised test of survivability to ensure the Player Character is suitable for combat, with foreshadowing lines like "You would make a great Squad Leader one day..." indicating the Squad Leader's death and imminent replacement by the Player Character, Unlocking the Squad System.

The Squad System for now is not introduced diegetically by another character in the world, but rather introduced more so as an Unlocked Feature - similar to the tone in a pop message like "NEW ABILITY UNLOCKED. PRESS "E" TO FIRE SO AND SO..." The Squad System is an extension of the player, allowing them to direct other squad members to activate a preselected ability on a visible target.
  
**Do you have an ending in mind for the game’s story? Are you planning to have multiple endings in the game? What will affect the possible endings if there are any? (500 words)**

  There is intention for multiple endings within the games narrative; as alluded to prior, we aim to present SOL DRIFT as a question being begged of the player which the final choice at the end of the game shall serve as their answer/solution.

Ending 1: The player is convinced and fulfils the wishes of "Conrad" and turns the weapon 
  

**If successful, do you have any plans for future stories within this world? DLC or sequels? Do you expect the player to play as the same character or someone else? (500 words)**

  Yes, the SOL DRIFT universe will continue after the events of the game but the state of the universe will be fundamentally changed forever after the cataclysmic eruption of one persons unrestricted potential which spreads across the stars and enraptures all those whom 
  
   the events of SOL DRIFT I believe have the potential to become powerful moments within the lore; much like how Half Life 1 you experience the events that are all fundamentally necessary for Half Life 2 and the player feels more connected to the world by having experienced something that 
  

**What additional mechanic, explicit or implicit, are you expecting to rely on to convey important story information? (200 words)**

  
  

**Does this game have a defined antagonist? (doesn’t necessarily have to) (100 words)**

  Our game relies on a compounding and escalating cast of antagonists all enraptured by the same event - It would begin with **Judge Squadron** and their highly personal vendetta against the player, creating a misleading expectation that they would be the primary antagonistic presence in the game.
  
Their untimely demise and frankly comical or pathetic only to be swiftly replaced with a far greater and 
  

**If you were to break your story down into key beats, from beginning to end, what would those story moments look like? (500 words)**

### Act 1
###### Welcome To The Front Soldier
You're introduced as a new pilot in training, you are on the receiving end of the propaganda, given the impressions of future glory but understand that you're on the bottom of that ladder - those who have seen more look at you with contempt? Pity? arrogance? You're not sure, and neither are they. 

###### You're an outsider, but you're impressive.
Your squad and leader structure begin to see your talents as a pilot and make notes, using you where they know you're most valuable - giving you surprise tough tasks with rising expectations. This comes with the caveat that you are not liked or even trusted, you're just useful.
###### The Worst That Could Happen...
Whisperings of a large scale invasion is spreading, word of elite groups now entering the fight are escalating in supporting evidence causing fearful prescient internal visions amongst some of their doom in this war.
###### We got your back, because we know you have ours.
Through continued demonstrations in gameplay vignettes your squad slowly warm to you, and whilst there are a few holdouts, the majority have come to accept you amongst them. 
###### We might have this in the bag
The pride in your squad is running high, you are being tasked with  more and more responsibility in regards to the war effort whilst those in high command are beginning to take note - the enemy seems to almost be a puppy getting kicked when your squadron appears and this has caused some in your group to grow cocky
###### Flying Too High 
Through your continued success Command issues your squad a highly sensitive mission that they believe you are best suited for **With help.** This is the first introduction of the PMC unit, they are a bolted on aspect of your unit in this mission and whilst it's not permanent - many are apprehensive, including your squad leader, there is tension and this marks the first significant tonal shift from the rest of the game, alluding to there being potentially more complex narrative beats ahead.

###### A Taste of No Rules
(PMC commander should have an EAR piece always in - to show he is being fed orders and thoughts from elsewhere - whilst HIS underlings should have full headphones and blacked out visors *Blind and deaf to their actions*)

Your current mission is to capture and secure willing defecting (and non willing) enemy science teams embedded in a research station deeply shrouded in classification - During extraction, the scientists reveal TALON's fascination with a specific star system and how it's activity has amplified in recent years, culminating in a recent radio broadcast they received from it (Kurtz's voice)

Upon reclamation and extraction of the scientists into a "Humbug" (Armoured Remote transport pod) the PMC commander is given an unintellible order and goes quiet. orders his squadron to destroy the pod - to the horror of your squad and the scientists! 

These civilians are scientists that are required to be rescued for the war effort, however, once they mention over comms that they have been monitoring a specific star system - the PMC commander receives an unintellible order
the PMC unit commits a heinous war crime leaving your squad dumbfounded, cutting the music and bringing the star-spangled bravado into a gut wrenching fizzle.
A screaming match breaks out on comms between the leader structure whilst the regular Pilots sit in horrified silence like children exposed to something horrific and having their bright and happy world poisoned by a sudden injection of horrid reality, exposing for the first time the true nature that was their absurd reality from before.  

###### Swept Under the Rug
The PMC unit is removed from your squad but not out of penal action but simply as a reaction from their command structure to distance them from your unit out of formality - in reality the PMC squad goes unpunished and is re-deployed to other squadrons.
###### The Worst Happens
In a routine mission, one that will mirror the banters' and emotional high points from previous missions you are ambushed by the Elite Judge squadron - your Squad leader is killed by Judge 1. 
###### Glory, Comradery - Fear
The mentioned massive invasion operation is a go, without even a moment to mourn, you the player are hoisted into your squad leaders role as you have demonstrated yourself throughout the events of the story thus far as a pilot of excelling quality - The scale and likelihood of death is at it's highest point at the very moment you and your squad as a unit are the least assured of success. The initial scenes of battle are of utter hopelessness and desolation on a scale that has not been seen in the game before, it should be overwhelming at first with numerous objectives that are under threat. 

###### Like Flies
One by one in fitting fashion your squad mates are killed, leaving you on your own to complete your objectives.
###### Unusual Activity
During the huge operation, your squad is tasked with taking down a data-centre that is operated by the enemy to reduce their intelligence power, during this you overhear the aforementioned star system from before has simply vanished.
###### A Word from God
During the invasion, just as the tide of warfare is evening and the player/UCA begins to see hope a cataclysmic call for order is heard through the unspeakably devastating, unexpected, unannounced and unknown blast from nowhere eliminates all parties in the operation bar a handful of ships that were fortunate to be outside of the main battle. This devastation also destroyed the colony planet in which was so desired by *Flooding* it in radiation.

### ACT 2

###### Survivors Fear Party
The surviving forces of the massive operation on your side are left indescribably unsettled by the events that caused the aforementioned devastation, your squads proximity to the event and privy to certain clues as to what happened put you in a uniquely beckoned position from your high command, placing you in the know of information that was previously well beyond your "need to know" basis.

In response to the attack, and after you continued highly impressive demonstrations (along) as a pilot and more so a division and through a compilation of various clues, your high command has issued a task of heading towards the implicated threat that wiped out massive numbers during the operation on both sides, this suspected threat is regarded as ultra priority - especially after the destruction of "Eden" 

The orders themselves make sense on the surface, but certain disparities make it clear that you're not being told everything - The orders however are very blunt in their directions, make your way to this star system and confront the source of the devastation and eliminate it as a threat. 

(Initiates the investigation into information given to play - eg, hanger puzzles begin.)

###### Renewal After Fire
Following the new orders and transfer, you are given a whole new squad, new ship and new style of operating procedure - you're exceptionally demonstrated but now you are working with hardened aces that answer to higher powers than you understand, the missions grow more vague and despite them supposedly being the most dedicated and loyal to the cause, patriotism and altruistic action for their country seems secondary in comparison to being akin to war machines.
###### Undisclosed but Available
There are breadcrumbs of a mystery; espionage, treason and conspiracy - puzzles to be solved.
###### Assembling The River
In order to reach your destination, you must hit certain targets to clear the way, acquire necessary tech/personal and reach a "jump point" - a mechanism assembled years ago that officially doesn't exist but is currently held in the enemies hands, yet, they are unaware of it's purpose.
###### An Assault of Glory and Lies
You witness the rallying and recruitment of another carrier for the cause - "Circus Of Malice" under the guise of making a large push for the UCA cause and taking back what is rightfully theirs, however, it is made clear behind the scenes between you and the black ops unit that this is just for needed manpower to eradicate enemy forces from the "Jump Point Facility" 

###### To Be With The Circus
It's made clear that this Carrier ship operates under very different rules compared to your last "" After having Served on such a back and forth front for so long (Jump point has changed hands many times) this force has deranged into mad tactics to make their operations work. "Circus of Malice" has effectively been forgotten in all but the way of receiving consistent reinforcements to further the meat grinder - but their methods are so far gone from military strategy that they are an absurd facsimile of a fighting force, especially compared to the player's initial introduction.

###### Denying Wobbling
The cracks in commands narrative is breaking down before your eyes yet all other characters perceive this as normality or not something to be concerned of, although your wingman should express heavy discomfort at much of the obscene and absurd things that end up occurring. (Witnessing COM member claiming to switch to auto pilot so he can sleep while flying towards enemy force claiming that the flak usually wakes him up *It's Joever*)

###### How High?
An All out assault on the Jump-Point shows the PMC unit now contracted by "Yellow For" to defend it from you

###### Judgements Day
When the PMC see's the tide of battle shifting, he attempts to bail on the fight but Judge 1 halts that be destroying him with a WMD style weapon, threatening the safety of the jump point, COM and your mission.

###### End Of The Circus
Judge 1 is defeated but as a final act, he uses his own ship as a WMD weapon to kamikaze the Circus of Malice, heavily damaging the jump station.

###### Repairing the soul
The chaos freed a prisoner kept in the brig of the station - A previous envoy to stop Kurtz - in his release aboard the jump station he scrambles a radio call to your squad when the mission seems FUBAR and the station lost to alert you that there is time to save it and he can accomplish this goal. 

In this time, you must assist this envoy with the repairs of the station - meanwhile you are an unfortunate auditory captive of this envoy as you **need** him and must listen to his ramblings of the mysterious figure at the head of this mission.


ACT 3

###### Judgement
Judge 1 is de
**Are you intending the player character to go on a personal arc of some kind? What should the player character learn (or fail to learn) by the end of the game’s story. How is this congruent with the message of the game? (400 words)**

  
  

**Have any core themes emerged from this stage of development? What are you saying as developers through this game, consciously or otherwise? (200 words)**

Throughout constructing the narrative of SOL DRIFT, it became clear that having villains is simply not convincing enough for us as developers; we want to create opposing forces that the player can rationally say "In their own way are as justified as us" but learn these facts simply too late.
  

**How would you like players to feel at the beginning of your game? How would you like them to feel when the credits roll? (500 words)**

  The word of the day is *Unassuming* 

###### A curious shrug
I want the player to enter SOL DRIFT with a sneering curiosity, looking at it like a mere Indie arcade space game that has all it's tricks loaded exclusively into the mechanics basket that they can expect might have some cool gimmicks but nothing overly outlandish. 
###### The Narrative begins before the game
SOL DRIFT should intentionally focus it's outward marketing allure on highlighting themes, tones and how the gameplay is blended with those but leave the specifics of the narrative as a pure unknown or weave them very subtly so that you can only perceive those planted seeds in said allusions *after* you have experienced the game story

Examples of this can be seen in[ **Spec Ops The Lines Trailer**](https://youtu.be/kIoJnMT3yUI?si=6Z9OGCeAmEGTz-Bk) with the shifting character model and dialogue excerpts referencing Hell and Walker having committed something awful - yet those details are lost in the flashy showcasing of gameplay moments and war bravado, perfectly priming the recipient audience.

Another example is [Mass Effect 1's Trailer](https://youtu.be/-_6ZMr2bMco?si=IrvKOypII_IHaQ5r) as it markets itself pretending that the Geth and Saren are the main villains, and makes *no illusions* to the Reapers and the shear threat level they impose - However this is valid to use because in the trailer it is alluded to about a galactic level threat that is (To the player who doesn't know) pinned on Saran's actions - yet after playing you realise his dialogue is spoken with fear, not conviction against something you're unaware of - which is what amplifies after the fact, the deliverance of the Mass Effect story as an experience - because you remember a time *before you knew* and how all those clues just slipped past you

###### The Hook to carry them forward
On those first play sessions, the player should be pleasantly surprised at how upliftingly cheesy, bombastic and engaging the mechanics combined with the unusual blend of unrestricted rule of cool design philosophy enhanced by a high attention to detail in niche area's to sell the plausibility of the setting, narrative, equipment and characters.

The balance of creating something Novel enough for people to want to try on it's own but engaging enough to hook a player so that they stick with the narrative through it's early unassuming levels to bring them to the point in the story where everything they thought the game would contain is blown out of the water in spectacular fashion 

All of this should culminate in a finale that when the credits roll the player should have their thoughts immediately snap back to the beginning of the game and how they felt when "it was just a funny space jet game" as their mind starts to recollect all of the themes and stack additional horrors onto their actions, the totality of what occurred and become almost sad that the "good times ended" via the original threat of the game being replaced with something that pulls the narrative stakes down to a horrifyingly personal level. 

(We intend to have menu screens that change based on the current Act) When the game is completed that menu screen when the player is booted back and the game is *Over* should absolutely instil a feeling of  "Oh. Fuck..." by showing a new screen that changes based on their choice (showing the devastation or hopelessness - Either a destroyed colony with floating battlefield debris of a previous battleground the player witnessed that is eerily silent now or a destroyed super weapon with a floating panel including the hopefully highly recognisable, by that point, flight number from their wingman's ship), so that when they boot the game up from that point on - that choice is brought back into reality and the consequences are made apparent and real.
