 #HangerModule

# Brief

### :LiLayers: Overview

The hanger Module is used as the space between missions that the player can physically walk around in and interact with various **Character NPC's** that will provide insight into the surrounding universe of *SOL DRIFT*  that will help provide the player extra means of engaging and relating to the struggles of those involved in the events of the narrative!

Players are encouraged to *explore their surroundings* as the battleship hanger has seen more crews, stories and pilots across her service than
**just you** 

*some dark corners might be hiding more than meets the eye!*

### :LiCodesandbox: Interactive Objects 

Littered around the hanger are various **Interactive Objects** that can be picked up and *inspected to reveal more about them*!

Some items might only contain pieces of *history* but others might contain **clues** needed to *solve the riddle of BOLT!*

### :luc_message_square: Interactive Characters

As players explore the hanger they will meet specific character NPC's that will come, go and evolve over the course of the game!

Each character has a specific Station that they are associable with and can be found near that Station area within the hanger exclusively, acting as an introductory guide at first for each of the hangers main offerings by being a face-to-the-function.

Before gameplay, it would be wise to talk to these characters found around your hanger, some will have certain tasks they may wish you to fulfill on a challenge board styled quest, completing it will grant a reward!

In addition to helping the player adjust to the hanger, each character will have their own personality and opinions of the current situation within the story - some may even have valuable insight or clues relating to The Puzzle.

### :LiLampDesk: Stations

Around the hanger are stations relating to a specific type of macro gameplay function or information storage!

The player can access all outside-gameplay functions within these stations and each one has a piece of the BOLT Riddle contained within it

Stations should be viewed as menu's given a space in a room.
