**Do with these, what you will, but here’s some structured questions,** 

**With some word limits, for you to fill out.** 

  

**Describe the Game, as you would to a publisher, in one or two sentences.** 

  

SOL DRIFT puts you in the pilot seat of cutting-edge Space Flight Warmachines at the forefront of a second “Cold War gone Hot”, a conflict that everyone’s grandparents warned all those who came after of never repeating the same mistake again. 

  

**Describe the Game, as you hope someone in a pub might describe it to a friend, having played it. Don’t be afraid to use other games as reference. (100 words max)**

  

“It’s like Top Gun in space. Just imagine Elite Dangerous mixed with the arcadeiness of Ace Combat with the personality of the Vietnam Era. Imagine a jet game, now make it faster and add a handbrake turn and put it in space.”

  

**Who is the player character? (500 words max)**

**How are you going to reconcile the player’s lack of knowledge with the player character’s lived history in this setting?**

  

Player character originates from a distant Colony State under the UCA and through their mandatory service as a young adult they distinguished themselves as a promising pilot. Following an escalation in intension between the UCA and Trisun (TBD) the UCA began stacking military forces along key strategic points which meant moving a lot of reserves from distant colonies. With this transfer to a UCA Carrier Ship the player now finds themselves suddenly in a new environment with different customs, expectations filled with unspoken rules, and harsh consequences to conduct. To survive, the player must adapt accordingly whilst the threat of war escalates and their re-deployment looks less like a promotion and more like a sentence.

  

Thankfully, the player was not sent into this new endeavor alone, when the player was first drafted, their home-colony best friend and companion enlisted that same day to join up too. During their shared training, the player and their friend shared a natural synergy leading to them serving in the same aircraft together as a pilot and a WSO (Weapons systems Operator).

  

  

**How do you plan to bridge the gap between the player’s knowledge, and the player character’s knowledge, if at all?**

Given the Player’s new found position in both environment and social standing they’re naturally at a disadvantage when it comes to understanding the customs of their surroundings and the inherent stakes at play. Therefore, both the player character and player themselves are in the same position of needing to learn the ropes, processes and hierarchy within this new setting. We’re planning on capitalizing as much as we can from the self insert “silent protagonist” and create a natural feeling of symbiosis and relation between the two; The Player’s learning curve is the Character’s. Furthermore, the choice to make the player a trainee pilot “of promise” explains them needing to go through general gameplay onboarding under the guise of training, a common method that helps reinforce a natural feeling introduction to the world and it’s characters, whilst bridging the connection to gameplay.

The way we want to communicate that feeling of being a lost lamb in a new place is initially through dialogue with other characters  (Squad mates, Commander, ground crew and automated Artificial Intelligence). We’re also interested in communicating the player’s home history and background through messages that they receive in their terminal, from family members saying their goodbyes and even smoldering letters from the burnt bridges they left behind with old friends. 

  
  

**How much of an existing character do you expect the player’s avatar to be? (500 max)** 

  
  

A lot of the information that will be available to the player is optionally explored but has an encouraged and tempting presence. Mementos and Items taken from home can be interacted with and will offer flavor text and context of where they came from and what kind of place that was, as well as establishing the idea the player character as a person, was different before the events of the game’s beginning, something that is an intentional choice as the growth, change and ultimate rebirth is a large part of SOL DRIFT’s narrative.

The player character directs the world through purely gameplay means. They are a literal vehicle being piloted by the player just like the character themselves pilots their jet. Likewise, the jet can only do what it’s told. The Character doesn’t apply input to the world - they receive it from a controller; the player and characters of higher standing within the world. However, we are utilizing the previously mentioned WSO as a proxy voice or means of expression from what would be the player character, sharing their reactions and opinions on the events that transpire. In this way, the Player, WSO and Character are all inhabiting the inner workings and dynamics of a single mind.  

  

**Describe the setting, and tone. Don’t be afraid to use other media as examples. (500 max)**

  

A surface level description of what we imagine the imagery and tonality of the setting is “Vietnam is Space”. 

**Setting:**

SOL DRIFT is following on from the current predicted trajectory of the privatization of space and applying that to the recurring lessons of tension between High-Interest groups and the resulting outbreaks of conflict that arises as a result. We aim to project the plausible outcome of what our world might look like roughly 150 years after a mass exodus of humans from Earth under the banners of various privatized space companies expanding into space using early-era space travel technology and techniques.

The state of SOL DRIFT’s universe is intended to explore the possible primitive colonial mindsets that might arise when humans separate from the confines of nation-states that have become inseparably linked to continental locations on Earth and what might occur when new flags and borders are formed in response to the new territories inhabited by a population with no inherent linkage to their ancestral homes. In essence, linking this future humanity directly to the faults and struggles of the past by showing it is an inevitable struggle of the human condition. 

  

**How far along into the story should you be starting? (200 Max)**

SOL DRIFT takes place two generations after (roughly 80 years) a massive decisively unwon war by all involved but one that could not be denied to have cost a great deal to all those who experienced it and their descendants. 

It was a watershed moment in the timeline of humanity and marked a significant transition from the innocent beginnings of the colonization of space by private companies where the borders between the colonists were purely a business concern, to new nations with citizens under new flags and law, no longer connected to Earth’s nations. 

You are the grandchildren of the generation that fought in this war, and that story lives on as just that; stories packed with warning and far off remembrance told through distant stares and foreboding warnings of repeating it.

SOL DRIFT’s story begins right before the eruption of a second war that comes after an 80 year cold war-like tension that has been slowly escalating but now has surprisingly ignited under unusual circumstances, leading to mass confusion, mixed support and a panicked mobilization. (hence the players sudden drafting from the outer-colonies)

  

**How can the game’s macro-narrative structure line up with how you’re conceptualising ‘chunks’ of the game. I.e. levels, chapters, acts, locations. (400 words)**

**Is there room for flexibility in the game’s narrative structure to accommodate cut content?**

**Do you foresee there being Dialogue options or any RPG elements in this game? Why or why not? (500 words)**

WE do not wish for any dialogue options but we do foresee a choice at the climax of the game acting as a player's indicative response to the message being told throughout the game. The reasoning for this is the aforementioned “vehicle” role the player character will perform; the story deliberately has them at the behest of other characters’/forces’ directions and intentions to amplify the message of “what happens when you no longer feel compelled by punitive consequences” - hence, at the end, the player will be given the ultimate decision, because no one else is left to stop them. 

  
**What sets the hook, narratively speaking, apart from other genre contemporaries? (200 words)**

SOL DRIFT’s setting and tone will incur the promise and lure of being less than it is but hiding so much more just under the surface that players will feel captivated by the uncertainty of what will come next, through it’s unusual and deliberately obfuscated moral messaging until the player themselves is given the opportunity to answer the question the game has been asking them and those around them throughout the game; SOL DRIFT is not attempting to tell people what the answer is, it’s asking them.

  

**Do you plan to localise this game’s narrative? Has any consideration been made thus far, as to a localisation strategy from a technical perspective.  (150 words)**

**Do other NPC’s exist within this setting? Do you have a rough idea of the character count? (1-10 core cast, 10-30, 50-100 etc.)**

**Who are the most important NPC’s that exist within the game’s story? Are there any NPC’s important to the game’s lore? Do any of these NPC’s have a pre-existing relationship to the player before the story begins? (600 words)**

 Squaddie 1 (Player's WSO): Voice of the player, originating from the same backwater colony as the player character, personally volunteering after hearing about the player character's drafting. Not acutely aware of the ins and outs of internal affairs, but inquisitive and suspicious enough to motivate the player to investigate. Initially Dismissive but aware of military's and PMC's decisions and how they affect missions and people around you. Personality slowly breaks down and cracks at the edges after engaging in the taxing missions, with a breaking point after the final conflict against Talon, where Talon is offered Mercy, but WSO executes him without hesitation, unceremoniously. WSO becomes the voice of Doctor Cardon after his death, quickly derailing the chain of command after executing yet another commanding officer, the Ops Handler, Shortly after the internal Coup fronted by the PMC, where the Carrier Ship is destroyed. Death of Ops Handler sparks final battle between player and WSO, lasting three rounds, progressing deeper into the MegaWeapon with each stage, ultimately ending with the WSO's death, but no the death of his influence...

Doctor Cardon: A genius scientist and a brilliant thinker, with weighty words and considered actions. He rivals others for being such a recognizable and intense cult of personality, akin to Kurtz or Conrad. Spearheaded initial research into FTL Travel, specializing in Wormhole Tech, disappearing shortly after testing a significant breakthrough in research, with it's launch point being a point of enormous secrecy and security within the "Black Ops" unit, with ultimately being an objective for the player to eventually follow. Enormous impact on the direction and outcome of the story, being be primary motivator and objective of the story after Act 1, through redacted terminal logs and encrypted radio chatter, jumbled signal degradation from deep space travel. Becomes a tangible character after meeting him in the beginning of Act 3. Provides the Player with the information, influence and perspective to make their decision.

Judge One: Leader of Judge Squadron, which ultimately is split into a cast of fragments of "judgement", all of which are facet of Judge One's Personality, with each loss affecting him in a specific way. Judge One and Judge Squad come after the player's carrier ship in the end of Act 1 after the UCA commit an inexcusable War Crime against Talon's general Infantry force. Judge Squad is the main rival throughout Act 2, ending in a Ultimate boss fight involving his 3 Pillars;
	Impartiality
	Transparency
	Jurisdiction
The Boss fight ends with WSO executing him.
  

**Do you have any plans for narrativising the game’s tutorialisation? Eg: do any characters teach the player core mechanics, or provide diegetic tutorial information? (300 words)**
Your first deployment teaches you the capability of your movement. " We know you did flight school but this is how we do things out here. The engineers hated us for starting it but we managed to convince them to push limits. (Talking about Drifting)". Diegetic Tutorial, involving the Squad Leader of your new Infantry taking you through an "Onboarding Course" for fresh Rookies. It's not the player being taught how to play the game, It's a disguised test of survivability to ensure the Player Character is suitable for combat, with foreshadowing lines like "You would make a great Squad Leader one day..." indicating the Squad Leader's death and imminent replacement by the Player Character, Unlocking the Squad System.

The Squad System for now is not introduced diegetically by another character in the world, but rather introduced more so as an Unlocked Feature - similar to the tone in a pop message like "NEW ABILITY UNLOCKED. PRESS "E" TO FIRE SO AND SO..." The Squad System is an extension of the player, allowing them to direct other squad members to activate a preselected ability on a visible target.
