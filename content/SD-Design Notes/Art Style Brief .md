The art style is very strongly inspired by the **Utilitarian** yet **Retro** **Scifi** aesthetic that *Starfield* manages to encapsulate - Blending old and new technologies to create a canvas with an immensely strong foundation soaked in style. The goal with this atmosphere is to make the player feel familiar within the environment, accommodating the player to focus more on the gameplay and less on a potentially *Jarring* environment.
