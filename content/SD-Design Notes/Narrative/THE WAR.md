# Prelude

The conflict that arose from the natural power struggle humanity has forever failed to contain came as no surprise to anyone with a firm grasp on the historical contexts of previous civilizations once proudly standing against the tides of time.

The Colony Wars cast humanities ugly traits into the heavens; The ignorant perpetration of their chaos offended the holistic order of the stars and drew *ire* from great eyes that see into the hearts of all to fully render the emotional drive behind the outrageous tragedies unfolding. Hatred is such a strong word, likewise is contempt, but those feelings equally fueled the blast furnace 

Amusingly, Humanity had no such inkling that their actions in EY-2076 would have such cosmic reactions, as though the universe itself would sneer on them for their lust for the apocalypses' glare.

A bomb, with a ferocity like that of a sun was unleashed and showed all who would doubt the undeniable persistence of humankind what was possible with enough drive to deliver the final word - The closing of a book can be a powerful symbol, it is the end of a story or conclusion of an idea but while the reader stirs and comprehends it's message the contents of the book remain unchanged, like a standing stone in the field of knowledge.
