The speaker acknowledges that for some of the newer students that the Vietnam war and it's consequences are **not** ancient history (**date of Video 1995**), but live <u>relatively fresh</u> in the minds of many and that it has taken a toll on both many individuals as well as general culture, especially in referring to it as a "defining trauma"

## The Admittance

**Robert McNamara** (<u>JFK's Vice President During Vietnam</u>) admits after a **30 year silence** that there were mistakes made during the war *from the presidency* out of a desire to uphold American Values, Robert wishes to impart lessons learned to the next generation

>What kind of toll must it take on a man who was at the helm of making such a costly decision, and how much greater was that toll to eventually declaring the mistake as such to not just himself but the American public?

#### Learning From The Past

 "*Examination of the past can help avoid conflicts in the future*."


#### Unintentional Disaster

Robert Discloses that 5 extraordinary meetings between World leaders involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis was the inspiration for his belief in learning from the mistakes of the past; **None of the world leaders intended to escalate to nuclear levels** Instead they held retrospective **reviews** of the conflict to better understand <u>what caused the escalation</u> between one another in the first place!

> This correlates with the notion of creating factions, leaders and elements within SOL DRIFT of a more nuanced nature - Despite those on the ground involved in the conflicts <u>especially</u> **Black Ops** likely feeling that they were dealing with a **rouge evil** that had to be culled - it's a fascinating implication to know that the truth (If we accept this as truth) could be a case of self defence out



# THREAT WAS REAL

The urgency and resolve of which the US acted was in a deterministic belief that the threat was real and that failure to act could have far reaching consequences across nations - whilst **not wanting conflict** they were prepared to enter one out of sheer defensive idealistic measures 

>The discussion of whether their ideals are justified or not is not the point; The conviction of their beliefs in a greater good is exactly the kind of rhetoric that creates a compelling faction conflict, especially when you introduce themes of misguidedness and halve-truths - When you have elements within a faction that **absolutely** believe in their cause, you have the justification for anything that might be needed, even if that means dipping into darker subjects. This would tap into the grim and morose experimentation programs that occurred as a result of the conflict  

During the **transfer of power** between Eisenhower and JFK there was a meeting that discussed the growing escalation and whether to intervene, Robert does not indulge the blame game and acknowledges that "The Choice was ours; <u>We Made The Mistake</u>" 

> It's an unusual thing to see a politician so brazenly re-focus the blame on themselves for such a serious problem.

# We Misjudged then, and we're misjudging today

Robert Directly calls parallels to the continuing of the same behaviours he regrets in the current power structure

>If Robert is moralising honestly about his role during the Vietnam War then it calls to question the "easy narrative" of evil politicians simply sitting back on a recliner of bodies they stacked in a bid for power - it instead proposes the idea that genuine motivations may lost in the fury and panic of the moment. This incurs an even more dire problem, that the folly of mankind is greater than it's resolve and growth from carnage.
 
#### An Ignorance of the culture & History

 
>Being ignorant of the true deep running emotions that drive those in conflict to continue their fighting is the root to the dissociative madness that permeated much of the darkest elements to Vietnam; fighting in an alien world against an enemy who fought with tactics and motivations unlike anything you understand from your home creates fear, uncertainty and paranoia on the battlefields amongst soldiers and War rooms amongst leaders alike.
>
>Much like the US, those who fight often do so out of a genuine commitment and **belief in the threat** to the point that they are <u>willing to carry on</u> with **their seemingly insane and ignorant goals** in spite of what would appear (to those **In retrospect**) to be common sense thinking - No greater evidence for that exists other than to hear the <u>very man who helped put America on the war path</u> be the same person to identify and deconstruct the madness of such a decision.

>"<u>War Bad</u>" is **NOT** the appropriate message to assign to what McNamara is saying, nor is it at all aligned with what any "Anti-War" message should be rooted in - instead the focus should be on pointing out the inconvenient and tragic truth of how conflicts start and persist amongst individuals.

>To declare American intervention a subject of it's own nationalism or American exceptionalism is incorrect according to the perspective of Robert; America was stung by it's own idealism, tragedy arose when they were confronted with an enemy motivated by nationalism. 
The impasse that was born was fuelled by the ignorance of said nationalism held by the opposing force leading to a dissociative view on that force
#### The Impasse
>The intrigue, controversy and explosion into conflict is born from the impasse created by two driving forces that exert an immense passion from within their people that is rooted in a sense of "**Not ignoring the threat**" and reacting to it - Both factions believe in their righteous idealism, a loyalty towards a larger than life calling that is inextricably linked to their sense of duty, purpose and self.

>The challenger doesn't necessarily want to destroy the other, nor are they seeking to bring Hell to Earth in a display of wrath and contempt for their enemies but again, their **only solution** has been undeniably chosen by the *impasse* they have been presented with
#### The Blood Cost & The No Solution

>The concept of a <u>blood cost</u> is one that feels only ever discussed **after the fact** as a shock value statistic, but something that stands out as being a morbid realisation is that cost is typically calculated **before** a war takes place and is responded to with indifference, ignorance or acceptance 

> "No Solution Possible" is a concept that sounds outrageous to the morally, politically and culturally motivated - when we enter a point of **impasse** the response of "there is no solution" feels utterly absurd, cowardly and defeatist

>But Perhaps, if we approach this from a perspective of patience than one of wilful obscurantism we can learn that a "No Solution" does not mean "*Will never be solved*"

>Robert McNamara is stating that responding to things in a reactionary way, one that seeks to curtail something you don't fully understand and can't fully predict the effects of with your own deterministic responses that are equally unwilling to forgo the cost of defeat then you are inviting yourself to repeating the mistakes of Vietnam and recreating the enormous, tragic and reducible **or** entirely avoidable  consequences of said conflict 

> As was said by Robert, they didn't have the senior staff advisors who KNEW the situation, like they did with Russia that helped prevent a nuclear escapade, their opponent was operating as an enemy to them, something that had every move marked as hostile and the solution was only ever to engage in hostile forms.
