## The Heart of Darkness - A Location

### An Introduction to Heart of Darkness
*(This analysis breaks down the characters using Freud's [theory of the Ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego#:~:text=of%20stomach%20acid.-,Ego,-%5Bedit%5D) and it's subsequent pieces. All understandings are purely subjective.)*

> The Heart of Darkness can be **interpreted as a location**. In the case of Joseph Conrad's book, we see it as the **African Wilderness**, deep within the Congo. The story follows Marlow, an accomplished Sailor recounting his travels through the Congo on a Steamboat. After receiving word that **Kurtz** (an extremely capable asset to "The Company" who brings in just as much Ivory as all the stations combined in Africa) has **fallen Ill**. 

> Kurtz is the **goal, the objective and the Liability** all at once. He is the reason Marlow must go down this treacherous path, he is the reason that so many tribes have been enslaved or butchered, he is the reason **"The Company"** is able to **turn in such a profit**. The Upper Management fear him, scared that their positions could be endangered. His workers admire him. And Marlow finds himself nearly **worshipping him**… more so the concept of him… From the various secondary characters that have projected their stories and mysteries of Kurtz onto Marlow, He soon builds Kurtz into something more than just another person - **a curiosity!**

> Marlow is obsessed with meeting him, hoping he can prove all the stories about him true or false, and the longer and more dangerous the path gets to meeting him, the more his interest brews, to the point if they found Kurtz dead, **what was the meaning of his journey.**

#### Regression

Time slows down as Marlow progresses down the river - the world around him **regressing** more and more into itself. Coming from the Thames River (Quite an advanced city for it's time) the jungle is a clearer contrast than any, stripping back the **layers of civilization** all the way to it's very core, leaving nothing behind but raw nature. Here there are no **punitive consequences** for the impulsive actions of man. 

In the jungle the human mind sinks deeper and deeper, past the [Ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego#:~:text=of%20stomach%20acid.-,Ego,-%5Bedit%5D), past the [Superego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego#:~:text=the%20unconscious.-,Superego,-%5Bedit%5D) and into the [Id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego#:~:text=%5B13%5D-,Id,-%5Bedit%5D), where you meet the devil on your shoulder face to face, embracing him. In modern society the superego keeps us in check, ensuring a **polite society**, doing it's best to understand and fight off the impulses of the id. The ego, a **mediator** in this circumstance, recognizes the consequences of **succumbing to the subconscious**, as Polite Society has judged it so. But what happens once that Society and Culture move away from breathing down your neck. 

```
"Parallel with the geographical retreat up the river into the wilderness
is a temporal journey backwards in time, leaving modern civilization
and returning to the lush, vegetative, prehuman swamp world, as well
as a psychological journey deep into his own personal heart of dark-
ness, where lurks the impulse to savagery that he had never acknowl-
edged wile in the deceptive milieu of a sophisticated city.”

#### Breaking the Mind

Joseph Conrad suffered from a mental breakdown before writing this book. He took the **journey to Africa** himself to experience it, viewing it as a Pilgrimage, a **Symbolic Act** that would open his eyes to the unknown mysteries of the mind. But he wasn't the only one to travel through Africa - [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes), a student of [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud%27s_psychoanalytic_theories) and an excellent psychologist, similarly undertook the "Symbolic Act" of travelling into the Heart of Darkness. Similar to how time slowed down for Marlow as he penetrated further into the jungle, Time seemed to slow down so much for Jung, he felt **threatened it would move backwards**… Jung coincidently suffered from a mental breakdown around the same time. However, what's remarkable about all of this is that the two never met each other, yet have experiences so aligned and connected. 

**The further you travel into the Heart of the Darkness, into your own Shadow, after stripping back the Imprint of Society and culture, after disregarding consequence and justice, the more you realize just how much capacity for Evil you truly have...**

#### True Reflection of Self

Towards the end of the book, Marlow finally finds Kurtz, a **husk of his former self**. The vision of a great leader and a point of great fascination to Marlow, shattered in a mere instant. Now standing before him is a feeble man, **broken and deranged**. Outside the camp there are poles lining the perimeter, each skewering the head of a Native. Marlow looks over Kurtz's report to the **International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs**, covered in a sprawling of messy words;
##### Exterminate the Brutes...

In Freudian terms, Kurtz represents the impulsive and wretched **Metaphorical Id** of Marlow, a living example of what long term exposure to your subconscious can do. Coming face to face with an image of your inner being, a creature capable of such **savagery and evil** after being revered for so long as a **great leader**...

Towards the end of the book once Marlow returns from his journey, he struggles to look at society the way he did before witnessing humanity's true nature;

```
"They trespassed upon my thoughts. They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretense, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew. Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces, so full of stupid importance."
