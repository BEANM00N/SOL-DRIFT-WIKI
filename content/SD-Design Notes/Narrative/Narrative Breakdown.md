### Themes 

The theme of SOL DRIFT derives heavily from the tone of the game; the thin line between **Madness and Control** that Pilots embrace into their *Soul* and exude through their artful **sky dance manoeuvring jousts** with an enemy they must respect if they could ever hope to beat `arrogance has been the death of many a fallen ACE` 
### Wax Wings 
In this, we find the lessons of Icarus and his **Wax Wings** given to him by his uncle - And thus, is a present theme within the game's narrative; pushing boundaries through a naïve overconfidence leading to an unrecoverable demise by a law of the natural world.
### Cold War 
The text of SOL DRIFT follows the escalation of a Cold War gone hot when the **uneasy stalemate** is broken by an anomalous technology that *shifts the rules for all.* 
Within 
### A journey Down 
The *subtext* and or *meta narrative* of SOL DRIFT is the experience of Soldiers experiencing the **shattering of the grand delusion** - when all they knew is corroded into a twisted mess and *the dance of survival no longer feels coordinated, dignified and righteous.* `The feeling of seeing something familair with unfamiliar eyes 
### Monkey With a Mortar 
The ruthless primal warfare of our ancestors lives on through the technology that may be more indicative of advanced civilization and by extensions **Ethics** but in reality is simply an extreme equivalent of giving a monkey a Club.
### Platoon's warning
The direness of this message is communicated most prominently by creating a searing unease that Soldiers who begin to misalign themselves from the given narrative are now threatened more by their own faction and surviving the enemy that is out to kill them becomes an afterthought `Watching your back has never been so easy - Because they all have their eyes on you when yours is turned.

# Culture of SOL DRIFT

General Cultural Attitude:

The pilots of SOL DRIFT’s universe are adrenaline junkies, physicked up on the propaganda fed to them by their militaristic front facing factions but their spirit to continue is fed by the meritocracy of their own incorporated capture as people under the flags of companies masquerading as nations.

Their blind optimistic loyalty and subsequent implicative awakening (within the narrative, experienced by the player) is representative of the sudden shift in patriotic duty, honor and loyalty felt by the children of _World War 2_ veterans as they themselves were fed into the death machine in a war that **failed** to maintain it’s do-or-die narrative.

The American Soldiers of World War 2 were more susceptible to their own nation’s propaganda in the war effort due to the more constrictive means of information flow. Most formed their opinions and motivations directly from the intelligence provided by superiors or radio broadcasts – (something that itself was highly controlled “for the war effort.”)  This was furthered by the outpouring of support from the _home front_; the population was rallied through the soldering fires of the pearl harbor attacks, helping to solidify the legitimacy of the threat internally.

Contrast this to the Vietnam war, where an exceptional number of soldiers were in dire disillusion with the very nature of their own status as “patriots” and instead became nihilistically demotivated with the realization that they were **drafted** to dodge bullets for things they didn’t understand. To add to this problem, the means of propagandizing the war machine was diminished through the anti-war movement leading to the general population’s disdain and growing intolerance of war

Pilots

The theme of the pilots in SOL DRIFT is **_measured insanity_** – _or, powerful instability constrained by survival driven stability **(something that emulates the very nature of what a fighter jet/space craft is – a balance between outrageous power made to adhere to delicate rules.**_) By extension, the gameplay itself is made to follow this trend. Each pilot must be capable of staring into the void with a The intense, dramatic and full-of-flair maneuvers that resemble a dance with death, exuding the kind of playful bravado in the face of peril that fighter pilots in our world (especially in the 70’s during the internal militaristic insanity that Vietnam caused, emulated with amplification by the children of those veterans during the 80’s.)  SOL DRIFT is a universe shaped by constant uneasy tension suppressed by unrealistic promises of stability; like a coiled spring with pressure being slowly applied, the inevitable cataclysmic release only grows with each new problem. 

Corroding POWER living off the loyalty born from a previous victory from an era long since outlived – resting on laurels as their enemies pursue.

Those who serve now do so with starry eyed conviction but aren’t ready for the reality of the ferocity that awaits. Nor do they have the same level of support from their country.

Scale is the greatest deceiver; something that is big is not always powerful and things that are small can often prove devastating.

Those who elevate themselves to see things from above are gifted with a rare perspective that is as raw as it is true.

From the pilots of the great war taking to the skies and seeing their beloved land below scorched and cratered – to the first astronauts to gaze down on their home world, later the first extraterrestrial born human laying their eyes on a photo of Earth – a home they never knew…

The beginning of space industrialisation in the year 2055 utterly upended the power dynamics of Earth nations; the explosive growth generated from the privatised space industry proved to be the slow death of world government’s ability to maintain a grasp on their territories – something only exasperated by the eventual reliance said governments had on the privatised space sector.

The economic boom sent a shockwave around the world, leading to a global rat race of trying to seize the giant pie in our night sky - The Moon was again the centre of a new space race.

In 2059 a joint programme was established between Three of the largest space companies in Asia that openly co-operated to create the largest production facility in the world at that time – it was an unapparelled move, made even more unexpected by the later “Merge” that was not an acquisition by any of the three companies, but rather an agreed dissolving of each of the existing brands to form a new powerhouse from their ashes. “Tryeiesun.”

 The combined production, reach, and financial capability dwarfed even the largest corporations on Earth at the time, putting immense pressure on other competing companies in the space industry to avoid being shunted out of the market by what was evolving into a continental sized opponent.

There was a lot of unfair market cornering from Tryeiesun in the years following; since no one could compete with their production scale, most focused on quality – in retaliation, TRYSN began restricting the availability of material imports to competitors through Vertical mergers of fuel, material, and mineral suppliers based in the Middle East and continent of Africa which soon became an international scandal.

 During an inquiry in 2062 launched by a coalition of European based PSFC’s but spearheaded through shared political fears across Europe, it was discovered just how insurmountable TRYSN’s dominance over the PSF industry was – the line had been blurred deeply between company and country, since TRISON was in essence a supercharging element for the continent of Asia by using the economic blast furnace that was the PSFI to enact political motives whilst also shutting down competition, leaving many countries at their mercy whilst traditional economy generators and industries (such as big Oil) started to dried up. (EV’s still require a power source.)

The Inquiry found TRISON guilty of corporate monopolisation, being anti competition and not disclosing the direct ties to political parties – however, a “shut down” order was impossible, and being so dependant on much of Asia’s imports, Europe found itself in a heinously difficult situation, thus, their hands were tied **politically**.

Feeling backed into a corner, that European Coalition of Space Flight Companies formed the “European Space Flight Union” (E.S.F.U) to effectively _scale up_ their own PSFI’s influence at home. The ESFU was officially deemed as an umbrella group with optional sign on. However, strongarming, oceans of red-tape and frustrating bureaucratic inconveniences made it a near mandatory

The “Quad launching” the first IFPU (Interstellar Factory Pre-fab Unit) to be established on the Moon in 2065 that would begin construction was the catalyst that ignited the political powder keg that had been slowly growing

The erosion of world government power against the ever expanding influence and weight the PSC ‘s were rapidly accumulating proved to be the undoing of their ubiquity across politics and the lives of their citizens, something that would seem implausible if not impossible just a few decades earlier but through the unanimous focus and inherent
