#### Notes to Remember...
```
 - Squad leader is the Ego. Your WSO acts as the Superego to the 
   player's Id. 

 - Carrier Ship is the steamboat through the jungle

 - Phantoms on the ship - Higher dimension has inperceptible 
   entities that can affect crew - Representing the creeping and 
   infecting madness of deep space

# ACT STRUCTURE

**Act 1** is a mission to mission structure that has explained rules, boundaries and outcomes with a clear sense of direction and explained
impact on the following mission with a goal always made to feel *JUST around the corner* 

This goal is achieved in act 1 to provide a "Was that it?" Moment to the player but it is announced that a Beacon from a "ship that doesn't exist" was picked up by your WSO during the last mission (The first instance of something not quite right in the story) 

As a result, the knowledge imparted and the seriousness of the signal places you and your WSO at the center of some very high up operations and the players proficiency is made to excuse the high-commands willingness to "promote" the player to be a part of the Black-Ops retrieval mission deep into unknown space where your badge, flag and regulations don't count for very much anymore.

**Act 2**'s structure will have very unknown direction, where each missions goals and results are the best guesses of your team, calls are made hastily at the time with hope for the best outcome
