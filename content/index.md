This is a very early **prototype** of an always online vault, based off the content found within our own **In House** Vault. 

*Dev Note*

File Structure is a little messy at the minute, partly because of  how picky this Static Site Generator can be, but mostly because we are disorganised and long overdue a cleanup...

To get started feel free to explore the file system on the left or make use of the search bar in top left, capable of everything the **Obsidian Search** can do (Tags, properties, words, etc.)

**Happy Reading!**
